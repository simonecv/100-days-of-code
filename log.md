### Day 2: March 21st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Installing ESP32 cameras

**Thoughts:** Flashed ESP32 camera using Arduino for the first time and experimented with Tasmota and ESPHome too

### Day 3: March 22nd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Datacamp Classes

**Thoughts:** Finished "Intermediate Python" and finished the "Analyzing TV Data" project

**Link to work:** [Intermediate Python Certificate](https://www.datacamp.com/statement-of-accomplishment/course/1adcfd3b38de15adfd1e1520528be4b593249dec)  and [Analyzing TV Data](https://learn.datacamp.com/projects/tv-data)

### Day 4: March 29th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Updating Tasmota to run the ESP 32 camera and sensors

**Thoughts:** As the tasmota firmware for ESP 32 is still beta, things were harder than needed but everything is running well now. I have installed Virtual Studio, PlatformIO and tried compiling my own code but ended up producing a custom one via a website.

### Day 5: March 30th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Installed MQTT and configured temperature/humidity sensors

**Thoughts:** The sensors were tested and work really well, and the MQTT broker is really nice. I now have to learn to automate this using NodeRED.
